üîç Project Spotlight: Vrinda Store Annual Report üìä

I am excited to share my recent project, the Vrinda Store Annual Report, where I applied my Excel skills to analyze and visualize sales data. This project involved several key tasks:

Data Cleaning: Used filters to clean and organize the data.
Monthly Sales Analysis: Created bar charts to compare orders vs. sales on a month-by-month basis.
Gender-based Sales: Utilized pie charts to display the sales distribution between men and women.
Order Status Analysis: Analyzed and visualized the status of orders.
Top 5 States by Sales: Identified the top-performing states in terms of sales.
Interactive Slicers: Implemented slicers for category, month, and channel to enable dynamic data exploration.

Key Insights:
Women are more likely to buy compared to men: Women account for 65% of the sales.
Top-performing states: Maharashtra, Karnataka, and Uttar Pradesh lead with 35% of total sales.
Dominant age group: The age group of 30-49 years contributes the most to sales, with an 80% share.
Top sales channels: Amazon, Flipkart, and Myntra contribute to 80% of the sales.
